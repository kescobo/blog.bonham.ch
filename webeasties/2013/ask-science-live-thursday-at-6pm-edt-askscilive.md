I'm trying [something new](http://asksciencelive.com/?p=37).

For several years now, I've been contributing to an online community called [r/askscience](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience). It's a place where curious people can ask questions, and have them answered - often with great, yet understandable detail - by expert scientists that have a passion for explaining their work. It's an amazing forum, and I'm continually astounded that so many scientists are so willing to donate their time and expertise to educate people, and that so many people are interested in hearing them do so.

Unfortunately, not everyone that would appreciate this sort of thing are using reddit, and so I decided to bring that ethos to another platform. I'm teaming up with some of the people from r/askscience to start a series of vcasts using [Google Hangouts](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cvgr2vu5eenvdstg1e60kf8taik) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/AskScienceLive/). We'll be taking questions live on twitter and google+ with #AskSciLive, and answering them as best we can.

We're soliciting questions ahead of time as well - if you have something you've always wanted to ask an astrochemist, but didn't know where to turn, send us a tweet! And please tune in live at 6pm US Eastern time on Thursday April 11th. Let us know if you think this is awesome, or if you think it sucks and you have a better idea. And if you're a scientist that would like to get involved on a future panel, let us know too! We'd love to have a deep bench of expertise to draw on.

We're scientists, this is an experiment, but here's hoping it goes well!

The First Panel:

Chad Jones - graduate student at Brigham Young University studying physical chemistry, and blogger at [thecollapsedwavefunction.com](http://thecollapsedwavefunction.com).

Matt Muckle - Completed graduate studies at the University of Virginia and specializes in molecular spectroscopy and astrochemistry.  His work has been published in science magazine and he now works designing novel instrumentation for analytical chemistry.

Andreas Lundberg - software engineer with experience in artificial intelligence and conventional software and a moderator at reddit’s [AskScience subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience)

Kevin Bonham  - graduate student studying Immunology at Harvard, and blogger at [scienceblogs.com/webeasties](http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties).
