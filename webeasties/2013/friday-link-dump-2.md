Science

- There's a [new flu strain](http://goo.gl/FOiay) running around in China. As is often the case, Maryn McKenna over at Wired has the most important [piece to read](http://goo.gl/xSIaO).

- Allie Wilkinson's [piece in Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/04/climate-change-may-be-irreversible-but-we-control-the-future-trajectory/) about a climate change's irreversibility, but not inevitability... it's a weird distinction, but it makes sense.

- Another [good post](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/collideascape/2013/04/03/anti-gmo-attitudes-on-the-left-and-right/) from Keith Kloor on GMOs, but I'm not a fan of equating Monsanto with GMOs. One is a company, the other is a technology. Just because the technology is used by the company, that does not imply that the two are related.

Not Science

- The [most important video](http://www.ted.com/talks/lawrence_lessig_we_the_people_and_the_republic_we_must_reclaim.html) I've seen in a while. Normally, I dislike TED - but this is important. Lawrence Lessig on money and politics

- Google bought up [Nik Software](http://www.niksoftware.com/) (tools for editing photographs), and recently released them all for cheap. I've been using them for less than 24 hours and I am in love... absolutely amazing. You can try them for 14 days for free. Only downside is you can't use them for non-destructive editing, but still.

Music

Haven't been listening to much music lately, but this song is amazing:
