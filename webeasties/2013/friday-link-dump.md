My blogging has been slacking, but I'm still reading a bunch that I just don't have time to comment on. So I'm going to experiment with a link dump at the end of the week. This first one features a [couple](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/collideascape/2013/03/08/a-rebuttal/#.UUjTvFt4bu0) week's worth of [posts](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/collideascape/2013/03/11/the-real-seeds-of-deception/) - feel free to start a discussion in the comments

Science

- Keith Kloor has a couple of posts in the [past](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/collideascape/2013/03/17/the-anti-gmo-movements-clever-marketing-gimmick/) few weeks about GMO scaremongering. I waded into the comments there, with varying levels of coherance. I'm working on an analogy about GMOs and rockets... more on that later maybe.

- Maryn McKenna [continues](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/03/uk-cmo-report/) in her [tradition](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/03/cre-cdc/) of being terrifying on the antibiotic resistant bacteria front - I would call it scaremongering if it weren't always completely scientifically accurate. Don't read before bed.

- Rob Dunn at SciAm's guest blog has an [interesting post](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2013/03/19/ten-predictions-on-the-future-of-your-microbial-health/) with predictions about how our understanding of our microbiome will change over the next decade. Bonus ideas from a number of great science bloggers in there too.

Not Science

- [Lots](http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/03/google-reader-will-rise-again-as-part-of-google/) of good stuff on the [sunsetting](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html) of Google Reader. [Here's ](http://www.extremetech.com/computing/101011-6-google-reader-replacements)some good alternatives (I'm trying [feedly](feedly.com) personally). I'm a huge fan of Google Reader, but don't really understand all the fury and cries of "EVIL!" Google has a right to stop supporting products that don't fit into their business plan. I like the idea of [open sourcing](https://plus.google.com/+TimOReilly/posts/9798Knrheh4) it, as there would undoubtably be people willing to take up the mantle, but as commenters noted, there could be a crap ton of work involved in doing that, and alternatives that already exist will be just as good.

- I rejiggered [my personal website](http://www.kevinbonham.com), and my girlfriend (she's a musician) [got hers launched](http://www.rachelrynick.com).

Music

My favorite song this week according to Last.fm:

[BOY - Little Numbers](http://vimeo.com/27190020) from [Grönland Records](http://vimeo.com/user4216968) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).
