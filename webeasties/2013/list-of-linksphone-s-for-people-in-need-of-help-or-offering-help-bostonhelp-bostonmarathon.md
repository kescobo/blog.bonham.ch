Not going to report, since the facts will probably change before I hit publish, but these links should remain useful:

[Google people finder](http://google.org/personfinder/2013-boston-explosions) - for folks that can't get in touch with friends/relatives

[Boston Globe-run form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1dqIKVq6IqX4BVXqOW_a9-qmXt1KJ_4Nu3NPNnC1g1mw/viewform) for people looking for or offering places in the city

Lots of folks offering help on twitter via [#BostonHelp](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bostonhelp&src=typd)

Mayor's hotline for people looking for friends/family 617-635-4500 (via [the globe](http://bostonglobe.com/metro/2013/04/15/explosions-rock-boston-marathon-finish-line-dozens-injured/yLhfDT1XC3HXSa8wPiVijL/story.html))

Anyone with videos/pictures of the route (could be evidence) call 800-494-TIPS (also via Boston Globe)

Red Cross is not looking for blood donations now, but would love you to [schedule for later](http://redcrossblood.org/) (site was down when I checked, probably heavy traffic right now)

I've been following this almost since the news broke, and I'm beat. Gonna disconnect from social media for a bit... I'm OK, and everyone closest to me is OK, but a lot of people are not. Even setting aside the injured, there are a lot of runners stranded (many area hotels are shut down) and could probably use help. Pitch in if you can.
