<p><em>This post initially appeared on <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties">Science Blogs</a></em></p>
<p>Lately, I find myself disagreeing with PZ far more than I used to on a number of matters. Today though, I think he's <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/dont_politicize_this_tragedy.php">100% correct:</a></p>
<p>What we have <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2011/01/beware_compulsive_centrists_an.php"><a href="http://scienceblogs.com/mikethemadbiologist/2011/01/the_absence_of_civility_is_not.php">here</a> </a>is an attempted assassination of a politician by an insane crank at a political event, in a state where the political discourse has been an unrelenting howl of eliminationist rhetoric and characterization of anyone to the left of Genghis Khan as a traitor and enemy of the state...and now, when six (including a nine year old girl) lie dead and another fourteen are wounded, now suddenly we're concerned that it is rude and politicizing a tragedy to point out that the right wing has produced a toxic atmosphere that pollutes our politics with hatred and the rhetoric of violence?</p>
<p>Screw that. Now is the time to politicize the hell out of this situation.</p>
<p>For anyone living in a cave (or in a lab) - a man <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/us/politics/09giffords.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&sq=giffords&st=cse&scp=1">walked into a crowd</a> and fired a semi-automatic weapon many times, apparently targeting a conservative democratic congresswoman, and killing or wounding 20 people. 
There's been plenty of talk about the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/24/sarah-palins-pac-puts-gun_n_511433.html">violent rhetoric</a> that's been spewed for the last 2 years, and many have blamed talk radio, Sarah Palin's map with cross-hairs over congressional districts (including congresswoman Giffords') and the like, and I don't have much to add on that front. There's been no direct connection, and there may never be, but I find it hard to believe that this atmosphere of violent hatred had nothing to do with this gunman's actions.</p>
<p>But I'm seeing the word "tone" coming up again. Some of you may remember there was a<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2010/11/rally_to_restore_something.php"> little event</a> in Washington a few months ago that had the intention of restoring sanity to our political discourse. This event was <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/10/the_rally_for_tone.php">panned</a> by folks like PZ for being to squishy, and <a href="http://my.firedoglake.com/thecallup/2010/11/06/watch-bill-maher-pans-john-stewart%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98restore-sanity%E2%80%99-rally%E2%80%99s-false-equivalency-theme/">by others</a> for a feeling of false-equivalency. I went to DC to join in because I think Jon Stewart's rally was an attempt to shine a light on the political environment that allows, if not outright condones the hate-mongering of the Limbaughs and Palins of the world. Others saw it differently, but let's be clear about a couple things in the next few skirmishes in the <a href="http://evolvingthoughts.net/2010/10/31/tone-wars/">tone-wars</a> that are likely to flare up due to this tragedy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folks like PZ Myers, for all their insulting and derogatory rhetoric have NEVER advocated violence. Ever. Against anyone.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There's a fundamental (not incremental) difference between calling someone stupid and calling them a traitor.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Calling for people to speak out against government abuses, or attempt to vote someone out of office is not the same as calling them terrorists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wherever you stand on the tone debate, let's just remember not to fold all passioned disagreement under the same umbrella with "<a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/SarahPalinUSA/status/10935548053">Don't retreat, reload.</a>"</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>Mike's got way better summaries here and here</p>
<p>Update 2: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/opinion/10krugman.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">Paul Krugman</a> makes largely the same point:</p>
<p>It's important to be clear here about the nature of our sickness. It's not a general lack of "civility," the favorite term of pundits who want to wish away fundamental policy disagreements. Politeness may be a virtue, but there's a big difference between bad manners and calls, explicit or implicit, for violence; insults aren't the same as incitement.</p>
