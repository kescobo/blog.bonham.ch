Dear SITN followers,

For a number of years, Science in the News (SITN) has organized a free public lecture series in the Brigham Circle/Longwood Medical area.  This spring, due to high demand, we are delighted to announce that we will be extending our lecture series into Cambridge!  For our extended series we will be having the following exciting lectures:

May 4

Black Holes and Cosmic Roles: Understanding the Center of the Galaxy

May 18

The Mystery of Sleep: How Neuroscientists are Solving One of the Brains Most Interesting Puzzles

June 1

Origins and Applications of Pluripotent Stem Cells

June 15

The War on Cancer: Where we Are in the Battle, and Why we Haven't Won. 
Each lecture will run from 7-9 pm in Pfizer Auditorium at Harvard University.  To get there, walk towards the Harvard Science Center onto Oxford Street.  Pfizer Auditorium will be on your right on Oxford street inside the building called the Mallinckrodt Building (12 Oxford St., Cambridge).  Directions can also be found at our website.

We look forward to seeing you all there!  
As with the [fall lecture series](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/seminar-archive-2010/), we'll be filming and posting the lectures on Vimeo.
