<p><em>This post initially appeared on <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties">Science Blogs</a></em></p>
<p>I got this e-mail from the president of my school yesterday:</p>
<p>Dear Members of the Harvard Community:</p>
<p>Starting this October, Harvard will celebrate its 375th birthday.  Such milestones encourage us to reflect on our institution's remarkable past--to remember that all we aspire to today finds inspiration in the creativity and commitment of those who have come before.</p>
<p>Even more, our forebears' example reminds us that, while we stand on the foundations they have built, we must never stand still.  Our history not only provides us with a sense of continuity and confidence; it highlights Harvard's tradition of imaginative change.</p>
<p>I don't really feel a strong connection to the Harvard community. Everything I know about the history of Harvard I learned today from glancing at wikipedia. <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1402">I gather*</a> that this is somewhat common among graduate students generally, but it's not helped by the fact that the med school where I work is several miles (and actually in different counties) <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=210190931036176032885.0004abd0f9706daefc3a5&msa=0&ll=42.359559,-71.076221&spn=0.086509,0.178871">from the college.</a></p>
<p>The summer before I came here, I was traveling abroad and was actually a bit hesitant to tell people where I was going to school. You meet a lot of people traveling on your own and staying in hostels, and naturally people want to know about you.</p>
<p>"What do you do?"</p>
<p>"I'm a scientist; I'm going to graduate school in the fall."</p>
<p>"Oh cool, where are you going to school?"</p>
<p>"Um... in Boston."</p>
<p>"Neat, but what school?"</p>
<p>"Oh, well um... Harvard."</p>
<p>"Oooohhhh."</p>
<p>Usually, that last line was accompanied by a slight backing away, as if there was a ring of defference that was a bit wider when the plebes interacted with someone going to so prestigious an institution. I hated it - it seemed like there was a perception that I was better than them or smarter than them, or at least that I might think I was better or smarter, and that always seemed to put up a wall, or add some distance that wasn't there before.   Or maybe it was just me projecting. 
Anyway, since moving here, I've gotten better at embracing the fact that I'm getting a PhD from a school that is quite literally world renowned (though I haven't managed to embrace it to quite the extent of  <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/about.php">some other people</a>, more's the pity). But I digress.</p>
<p>Harvard was founded in 1636. For any Europeans reading, that may not seem that old, but it's ancient in terms of American institutions - 140 years before there even was a United States of America. </p>
<p>The history and prestige of this place aren't always (or even often) out on display. It's not something I think about on a daily basis. But it's there. I doubt I'll take part in much of the anniversary festivities, but I did manage to stop and reflect on 375 years of history. I know much of it was wonderful. I imagine much of it was not. My school's moto is Veritas.</p>
<p>Truth.</p>
<p>That's what I'm looking for. I hope I find it.</p>

<hr>
<p>*For the record, I scored 2pts on this quiz.</p>
