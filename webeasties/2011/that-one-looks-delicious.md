While researching my recent post on the Nobel Prize, I discovered that the website has a series of "[educational productions](http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/all_productions.html)," including games and written/illustrated primers on different topics. I've been playing the [malaria game](http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/malaria/mosquito.html) all morning - you have to fly a mosquito around drinking the blood of humans while avoiding bug spray and mosquito nets and birds, but first you get a little lesson telling you about how malaria is transmitted.

Or play [immune system defender](http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/immunity/game/index.html) where general macrophage teaches you how to hunt down the nefarious bacterial invaders.

The [written articles](http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/immunity/immune-detail.html) are pretty good too, and the illustrations (like the one above) are great. I mostly looked at the medicine ones, but there's educational games/articles for the other prizes too. Anyone that can make a game out of [chemical chirality](http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/chemistry/chiral/) deserves some recognition.
