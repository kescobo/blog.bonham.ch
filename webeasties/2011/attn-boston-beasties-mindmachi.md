Harvard Science in the News begins its [fall lecture series](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/sitn-seminars/) this week with a talk on the interface between human brains and machines:

I went to the practice talk last week, and it's going to be great! From retinal implants to controlling robots with your mind, Harvard neuroscience graduate students will take you through the science behind melding mind with machine. The lecture is tomorrow (wednesday) night at 7pm in the Armenise amphitheater at the Harvard Med School. Check out [the website](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/sitn-seminars/) for more info.

Next week: Me! I'll be presenting next wednesday along with my lab mate Sky Brubaker and fellow immunology grad student Jillian Astarita on innate immunity - "How to Spot a Virus: The Origins of an Immune Response."
