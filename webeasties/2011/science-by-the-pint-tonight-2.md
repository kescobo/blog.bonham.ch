If you're in the greater Boston area, go get your beer on and learn some great science!

This is a reminder that Science by the Pint is tonight at 7pm at Tavern in the Square in Porter Square. As usual, we'll raffle off a \$10 gift certificate for every 10 attendees.

We're bringing [Welkin Johnson ](http://micro.med.harvard.edu/faculty/johnson.html)and his lab members to talk about how viruses like HIV replicate.

Heather had [a great time](http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2011/03/why_i_love_science_by_the_pint.php) last month - you can have a great time this month!

Beer, science... what's not to love?
