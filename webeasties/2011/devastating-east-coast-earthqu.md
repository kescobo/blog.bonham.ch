I didn't feel it, and growing up in California, it might not have even registered. Then again, the reaction (general fear, disbelief, and confusion) is about what I would expect if we received even a half inch of snow in San Diego. But maybe now people out here in Boston won't be so confused when I mention my deep-seated fear of brick buildings.

In other "disaster" related news, [my computer](http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2011/08/what_passes_for_tragedy.php) has a fresh hard-drive, though I had to restore my data from a few weeks ago, so I lost some photos, but not much else. On the whole, it could have been a lot worse.
