I'm on vacation this week, but was working on a post about the evolution of antibodies to be posted yesterday. Unfortunately, what greeted me when I turned on my computer thursday was this:

I'm actually a little surprised at how well I'm handling it, I would have expected that I'd be a wreck. Maybe it's my current [idyllic location](http://www.vtfpr.org/parks/htm/catherine.htm), or watching season 5 of [Six Feet Under](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Feet_Under_(TV_series)) to give me perspective, or maybe it's the fact that I just decided to to a time-machine back up for the first time just before I left (which means, barring a meltdown on my external hard drive, the worst case is that I'll loose is a handful of photos and my antibodies post), but I'm not actually that worried. All of my data lives in at least one other location, so even though it would be a bit of a pain to re-make figures, even without the back-up, none of the raw data would be lost. 
Hopefully (probably), I'll be able to recover everything. Until then though, I think I'll go swimming in the lake, and be grateful that computer trouble is what currently passes for tragedy in my life.
