## Explanation

From 2010-2013, I wrote the [*We, Beasties*][webeasties] blog
on scienceblogs.com.

The site is still there, but I decided I should grab the content,
just in case. 
You can read how I did this using `julia` in a 2-part post;

- [Part 1](/posts/webeasties-1)
- [Part 2](/posts/webeasties-2)

This is just an archive of that written content.
Enjoy!
