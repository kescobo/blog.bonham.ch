Welcome to the new Science Blogs. You might have noticed some changes around here - let us know which changes you like and which you don't. One of the biggest things affecting your experience is the comment system - you can now reply directly to other people's comments, and you can login so you don't have to re-enter all your information each time (though you can still comment without logging in if you prefer). The moderation system is quite a bit easier from my end, which shouldn't affect you much, but will probably reduce the number of legitimate comments that get buried in the spam folder.

Despite my New Year's Resolution to blog more, I've continued to be delinquent, but I'm going to shamelessly blame it on the transition and attempt to re-up now (never mind the fact that plenty of other people have continued to do fine work over the last couple of months). Also, I plan to run a series of re-posts of some of my favorites over the last couple of years - I'm hoping we're about to get some new readers from the NatGeo network, and these will hopefully give folks a way to get acquainted with the sort of stuff I write about here at We Beasties.

Let me know what you like about the new design, what you dislike, and if there's anything you're not seeing that you'd like to see (both in terms of style and of content).
