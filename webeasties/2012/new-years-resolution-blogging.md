My birthday was last week, which means I get a whole new chance to set some New Year's resolutions. My regular readers (all 3 of you) might have noticed a serious dearth of posting lately. I have many excuses:

1) I'm (hopefully) coming up on my last year as a PhD student, and I'm in serious data-generation mode. 
2) I've been spending more time on climbing, photography, and other things that are not science-related in order to give my brain some down time.

3) The current back-end of Scienceblogs is truly awful. While writing my [last post](http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2012/02/im_too_sexy_for_your_virus.php) on our sexy, sexy immune systems, the post was almost entirely lost at one point when I was near the end. We've been told that we'll be migrating to the new wordpress backend sometime in the next few weeks, but it was originally supposed to happen back in January, so who really knows?

In the end though, these aren't great excuses, and I've been thinking it's time to get back in the saddle. I usually try to keep my resolutions manageable - I probably won't be doing 5 posts/week. But once/week? Maybe if you'll indulge me linking to music videos and other random crap every so often, I can get that up to 2 or 3 times/week. I'll try to keep it mostly substantive though.

And, as always, if you have any ideas for stuff you'd like me to write about, don't hesitate to leave a comment or shoot me an e-mail.
