My house got broken into last week, and then we had a rock thrown through a window a few days later (possibly related). So I had to deal with a bunch of stuff last week, and am still dealing with stuff today, and I need to catch up at work, yada yada yada.... 
All of which is to say the post I wanted to write about TLR's being involved in itching sensation (me? neuroscience?), might have to be postponed until tomorrow. In the mean-time, I hope you enjoy this song I've been listening to a lot recently.

What sort of music do you listen to to get through stressful/eventful times?
