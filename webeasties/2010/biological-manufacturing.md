Sometimes, when I take a step back and look at the ways that we can manipulate life, I'm astounded. We can breed mice that lack any gene we want. We can also insert new genes, and have them [only express](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cre-Lox_recombination) in certain types of cells or only at certain times. This is routine. We can make design viruses to [insert genes](http://www.businessweek.com/lifestyle/content/healthday/646941.html) into human cells to cure, cure debilitating diseases.

We have bacteria that [play sudoku](http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2010/11/problem_solving_bacteria.php), and we have mice born with [two fathers](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/12/my_mouse_has_two_daddies.php). We can [make corn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bt_corn#Bt_corn) express toxins from Bacillus that only kill pests, and [tobacco](http://goo.gl/RhQ2H) and [cats](http://goo.gl/8Bay7) that glow green (through two different mechanisms even).

Our understanding and our technology is moving fast. For many years, I've envisioned the day when buildings will be genetically engineered and grown from seeds. Most people (even other biologists) thought I was crazy, but now [I feel validated](http://www.gizmag.com/mercedes-benz-biome-concept/17096/):

Picture a production process that has plenty in common with agar jelly (used to culture organic materials in laboratories) and little in common with what we would normally think of as production-line automotive manufacturing. You are starting to get close to what the people at Mercedes-Benz have spawned with the BIOME - one of the most outlandish and ambitious concepts in this year's Los Angeles Design Challenge.

In short, the BIOME would be grown in a lab rather than built on a production line.

To be fair, this is from a [design competition](http://www.laautoshow.com/DC10/Mercedes-Benz.html), and a lot of the concepts here are significantly beyond our current level of technology, but I think the spirit of the idea is sound.

I actually don't think it will be that long (within my life time) before we're at least growing more components for manufacturing using living systems, if not entire structures. If that seems crazy to you, read the first two paragraphs again.
