We beasties came together through our love of microbes, but also through a graduate student group called [Science in the News](sitn.hms.harvard.edu). [SITN](/tag/sitn) is completely run by graduate students, and our mission (much like the mission of this blog) is to share our love of science with the general public. We have a lot of events to this end, from school out-reach to a [monthly newsletter](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/sitn-flash/) to Science Cafes (called "Science by the pint" - we basically get drunk and talk science with whoever happens to be in the bar). But our main event is a [lecture series](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/sitn-seminars/) every fall. 
And it just so happens that this week, I'll be presenting on a topic near and dear to our hearts here at We Beasties, "Our Microbial Organ: The Good and Bad Bugs of the Human Gut."

If you're in the Boston area, you should come check it out. It'll be Wednesday from 7-9 in the Armenise amphitheater at the Harvard Medical School. And if you can't make it, we're also[ posting video](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/seminar-archive-2010/) (we're trying to do it in a timely fashion, but I'm in charge of video).
