If you're in the Boston area, [come see me](scienceblogs.com/webeasties/science_in_the_news_microbes_o) (and two other awesome grad students) give a [talk ](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/sitn-seminars/)on microbes, especially the ones that live in you and on you.

We've got everything from [fecal transplants](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/science/13micro.html?pagewanted=all) to whether bacteria can make you fat or not. Come out to Armenise amphitheater at the Harvard Medical School at 7pm, you won't regret it!
