I am an Assistant Professor
in the Department of Medicine at Tufts Medical Center.
I study the human microbiome :hankey: :toilet:
and its effect on brain :brain: development in kids :baby:,
and write to make it easier to analyze complex biological datasets.

Feel free to [be in touch](/contact/)!

I also write open-source software for the [julia programming language](http://julialang.org).

## Code

Most of my code is [on github][github], including the code for [this site][site-code]!
Some other code is on [gitlab][gitlab], though I mostly put private repos there.
