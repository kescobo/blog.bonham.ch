It's that season again!
No, I'm not talking about the High Holy Days,
Halloween, or Thanksgiving...
It tenure-track faculty application time!

I have recently been playing around with $\LaTeX$,
the type-setting engine, and I've hit upon a pretty sweet workflow
for writing application materials using it
along with git,
enabling me to write one "generic" or template version,
then tweaking or filling in place-holders for specific positions.

Let me show you!

## Motivation

To grasp the benefits of the new system, it might be worth
describing my previous workflow and its limitations.
My previous workflow was as follows:

1. Make a google doc for each application component
   (Eg. Cover letter, Research statement, Teaching statement, Statement on diversity and inclusion).
   I would include places where I'd want to insert job-specific information,
   like
   >In my independent lab at **INSTITUTION**, I will...
   or
   > Dear XXX and members of the search committee, ...
2. For each job app, make a copy of each document,
   and rename it to eg "Northeastern - Cover Letter" from "Cover Letter".
3. Change all generic placeholders to specific ones, eg.

   >In my independent lab at Northeastern, I will...
4. Add any job-specific flavor. For example,
   If I'm applying to a job at HMS, I'll mention in the cover letter
   that it's where I did my PhD, and maybe do some name-dropping.
   Or when applying to a place that has a great teaching and learning center
   (like [Northeastern's CATLR][catlr] or [Harvard's Bok Center][bok]),
   I'll add some stuff about working with them to my teaching statement.
5. When I'm ready to apply, click through each document, and download it.

[catlr]: https://learning.northeastern.edu
[bok]: https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/

There are several limitations to this approach,
here's just a smattering:

- Tons of duplication; I applied for ~13 positions this year,
  and each one has at least 4 documents, meaning that I have over 50 documents from this year alone.\\
  ... and I am probably on the low end of total applications
- All the pointing and clicking is tedious.
  Making copies, opening the documents, changing document names, downloading, etc.
  Doing this a few times would be bearable but 50 times?
- Nothing is scriptable; if I find a typo after I've made copies and want to change it,
  it means copying, clicking through ~13 documents, finding the right place, and pasting.
  The opportunities for missing things or screwing them up is extensive.

This last is particularly painful if,
after I've made all of my copies, as I'm working on one of the specific apps,
I find something I want to change, even just a typo.
It means going back to the template and every copy I've made manually.
Sometimes the documents have already undergone a bunch of revision,
so even finding where the problem is, or knowing how persistent the type was
can be a challenge.

### What I wanted

So, what I wanted was something that

1. has a single master version of each document
2. is easy to propagate changes from any version and regenerate outputs
3. doesn't have dozens of versions floating around in different folders

## LaTeX Workflow and templates

First, a disclaimer about what this post **isn't**:

1. An introduction to `git` - if you're not familiar with it,
   maybe this can be your motivation to learn! It's worth it!
   And there are a ton of good resources about it online already.
2. An introduction to $\LaTeX$ - frankly, you wouldn't want me to try to teach it,
   I've mostly cobbled together what little I know from looking at [Overleaf Documentation][overleaf]
   and the [TeX Stack Exchange][stackexchange].\\
   I do provide [some templates][templaterepo] to get you started.
   In case it helps, I'm using the LaTeX workbench extension of VS Code
   on Ubuntu and installed LaTeX with `sudo apt install texlive-full`,
   but you'll want to look up install instructions for your own OS.
3. Advice on how to apply for academic positions or what to put
   in your cover letter / CV / research statement etc.
   I haven't landed an academic job yet,
   so you wouldn't want to trust my advice on this anyway.

### Generic files with placeholders

Write your materials as you normally would,
except for the following:

1. Use [semantic line breaks][sembr].
2. Put anything that will likely change for your different apps
   on their own line

[sembr]: https://sembr.org

#### Semantic line breaks

Semantic line breaks (sembr) can take a little getting used to,
but they make version control on plain text documents
much more powerful.
The basic idea is that, in file formats like markdown and TeX,
newlines are treated the same as spaces
in the rendered text.
For example, this paragraph looks like this
in the source code:

```md

but they make version control on plain text documents

The basic idea is that, in file formats like markdown and TeX,
newlines are treated the same as spaces
in the rendered text.
For example, this paragraph looks like this
in the source code:
```

This explains a bit about how,
but you may be wondering *why?*.
The reason is that git version control works
on a line-by-line basis,
so if you end up making a change,
it's much clearer to have this diff:

![A code diff showing a change to a short line of text](/assets/img/good_diff.png)

rather than this one:

![A code diff showing a small change to a long line of text](/assets/img/bad_diff.png)

It will also make it easier to make corrections
and changes to one version and propagate them to other versions
as we will see.

#### Separate lines for placeholders

The exact same logic applies to placeholders
(eg. "...at INSTITUTION" to "...at Northeastern");
since you *know* you're going to change these bits,
keep them on separate lines to keep the diffs nice.

But it also keeps your app-specific changes
separate from any other changes
that you might make,
which makes it easy to merge those changes
without conflicts.

```latex
For example,
suppose I have the following text about
\hl{INTITUTION}
that has a typoo on the last line.
```

Suppose I go though and change `\hl{INSTITUTION}`
to `Northeastern` in one of my applications,
then, as I'm editing my `Harvard` application,
I notice the typo.
I can go fix the typo on my `main` branch,
then merge the fix for that line into my other branches
without conflicting with any of the other changes.

Don't worry, I'll show how to do this in a bit.

### Use separate branches for specific applications

Once you have your individual generic documents ready,
it's time to customize them for your specific applications.
Rather than making copies of the files,
use `git` **branches**.

For example:

```sh
❯ git checkout -b umass-ex # University of Massachusetts, Example
# make changes to `research.tex` and save them
❯ git commit -am "update research statement"
# make changes to `teaching.tex`
❯ git commit -am "update teaching statement"
```

If you notice a typo that you want to fix,
commit everything you have, then

```sh
❯ git checkout main # this might be `master` instead of `main`
# fix the typo
❯ git commit -am "fix typo"
❯ git checkout umass-ex
❯ git merge main
```

If you have other branches, you can just check them out
and merge there as well.

#### `cherry-pick`ing (advanced)

Sometimes, I don't want to break up my writing flow
by dealing with all of this branch changes.
Instead, you can wait and then use `git cherry-pick` to grab
a single commit from your app-specific branch onto `main`.
That is, on the `umass-ex` branch:

```sh
❯ git commit -am "update research statement"
# fix a typo
❯ git commit -am "fix apostrophe"
# keep working on research
❯ git commit -am "more substitutions on research statement"
# work on teaching
❯ git commit -am "update teaching statement"
# now ready to update `main` branch
❯ git log --oneline
```

![snippet of output from `git log --oneline`](/assets/img/gitlog_hash.png)

Running `git log --oneline` will give you a list of commits
with your commit messages in reverse order
(see why having descriptive messages is nice?)
and the **commit hash** which you can use to refer to each commit.

Now, to get *just that one change* back on to your main branch
(or any others),
just check the branch out and do `git cherry-pick`:

```sh
❯ git checkout main
❯ git cherry-pick 11aa748
```

Now, if you've been using semantic line breaks,
and assuming you haven't previously made changes to the same line,
your `main` branch should be updated! Magic!

### Export

This was the place that felt like the most time was saved.
Clicking through `file -> Download As -> pdf` on
each document was so tedious,
especially as, if you're anything like me,
you'll have to do this 10 times per document as you notice more and more typos.

Because the name of your current git branch can be identified
with the command `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`,
you can simply checkout each branch and make a copy of each `.pdf`
with the branch name attached.

I [use `fish`][fish], which has a slightly different syntax
than the shell you might be familiar with,
but the following makes a copy of each pdf into my `~/Downloads` directory
with the name of the git branch prepended (eg `umass-ex-research.pdf`):


```
for f in (ls jobapps/*.pdf)
    cp $f ~/Downloads/(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)-(basename $f)
end
```

[fish]: https://fishshell.com

The same thing in a POSIX shell like bash or zsh is something like this:

```bash
for f in $(ls jobapps/*.pdf); do
    cp $f ~/Downloads/$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)-$(basename "$f")
done
```

## Conclusion

I'm not sure if this would save you a ton of time
if you haven't already been working on learning LaTeX for other reasons.
But as I have been, it was a good learning experience and (I think)
ultimately *did* save me a bunch of time.

If you want to play around with it,
you can use this [demo repo][templaterepo] that I set up
to give it a whirl.
Have fun!
