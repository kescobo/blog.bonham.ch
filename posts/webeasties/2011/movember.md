Well, this is going to be embarrassing.

This year, some friends and I are participating in "[Movember](http://mobro.co/kevbonham)," an effort to raise money for prostate cancer research by having men embarrass themselves with ridiculous mustaches This is a shot of me this past weekend:

But alas, that fine follicular growth is entirely artificial. 
If you've ever read the description under my picture to the left, and wondered what I'm talking about when I say "genetically incapable of growing facial hair," you'll get a chance to see exactly what I mean. And since my "mustache" is going to be such a travesty, I hope to take solace in crushing my competition on the fundraising. 
[[Donate](http://mobro.co/kevbonham)](http://mobro.co/kevbonham) to encourage me to embarrass myself. [Donate ](http://mobro.co/kevbonham)to me to embarrass my competitors. Donate to support men's health. 
And check back here for weekly updates - you'll definitely be disappointed.
