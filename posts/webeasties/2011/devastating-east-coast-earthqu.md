I didn't feel it, and growing up in California, it might not have even registered.

In other "disaster" related news, [my computer](http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2011/08/what_passes_for_tragedy.php) has a fresh hard-drive, though I had to restore my data from a few weeks ago, so I lost some photos, but not much else. On the whole, it could have been a lot worse.
