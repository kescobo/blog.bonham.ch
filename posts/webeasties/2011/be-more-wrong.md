I wrote awhile back about an [incredible book](http://scienceblogs.com/webeasties/2011/01/how_being_wrong_can_be_so_righ.php), Being Wrong by Kathryn Shultz. The author recently have a talk at a TED conference, and her talk has just been posted. I was honestly a bit disappointed by the talk, but it gives me a chance to highly recommend [the book](http://www.amazon.com/Being-Wrong-Adventures-Margin-Error/dp/0061176044) again. Read it, seriously.
