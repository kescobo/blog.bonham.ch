Been working hard on lab science, so I haven't had as much time for blog science, but I thought I'd share something else I'm proud of:

My friend Matt and I hiked to the top of Mount Jefferson in northern New Hampshire this past weekend with a table, 2 chairs, a bottle of wine, glasses, camera and tripod strapped to our backs. It was quite strenuous, and we didn't actually end up using the chairs (which were an extra 15lbs or so that I trudged up 4000 vertical feet with), but it was totally worth it.

The GPS track and more pictures after the jump.
