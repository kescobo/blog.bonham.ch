Ever wonder what exactly a Toxic Asset is? Follow the engaging story of [Toxie](http://goo.gl/UtQbm) the [toxic asset](/tag/toxic-asset) on This American Life.

This is just the latest in a series of amazing reporting on the [financial crisis](/tag/financial-crisis) from a radio show that is not generally concerned with what would be traditionally thought of as "news."  "[The Giant Pool of Money](http://goo.gl/zngrO)," which started this series, is still the best break-down of what caused the financial crisis that I've seen. And a [follow-up piece](http://goo.gl/0gzWw) a year later gave even more perspective. 
If you read or hear news about the financial crisis but just don't quite get what it all means, listen to these programs. They're engaging, informative and incredibly entertaining.
