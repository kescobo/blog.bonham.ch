I'm from California, but this is my third New England winter (though last year doesn't really count since Washington DC and New York stole al our snow). Even I know, this is a really important message:

And the tips for idiots (mentioned at 0:57) are especially important:

- Do not attempt to mow lawn

- Do not eat de-icing salt

- Do not start fires indoors

- If you pee on yourself, change pants immediately [it may start off feeling warmer, but wet cotton = hypothermia - kb]

- Wear mittens

- Snow is cold

- A garbage bag does not make a "great coat"

- Keep icicles out of eyes

Be safe out there guys!
