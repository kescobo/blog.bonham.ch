The thing I like most about [this mashup](http://youtu.be/6mkn7YICHI8) is that it's superficially just a mashup of the most popular music of 2011, but it also manages to be a statement on some of the most important events of 2011: the protests from Egypt and Libya to OWS

Maybe it's hard

We will never be never be broken and scarred

There's no way I'm turning back oh oh oh oh

Here's the situation

Got this feeling that you can't fight

Been to every nation

The city is on fire tonight

Maybe it's hard

We will never be never be broken and scarred

There's no way I'm turning back oh oh oh oh

Here's the situation

Got this feeling that you can't fight

Been to every nation

The city is on fire tonight

You wanted control

But you're a liar

And now everything is on fire

Don't underestimate things like this[...]  
Take it all

Take the house

Take my car

Take the change in my pocket

I'm a superstar

We ain't stoppin'[...]

The show goes on

every night and day

The dream goes on

standing side by side

all again
