I use DataFrames.jl *all* the time.
It's incredibly well engineered, well-tested, and fast!
But there's one aspect that's eluded me for a while,
and that's the "mini-language" that's used for `transform`ations
and `combine`ing grouped DataFrames.
I could use it for basic stuff, but for anything even moderately complicated,
I'd have to puzzle over the documentation and then go through endless
rounds of trial and error.

This blog post by the primary architect of `DataFrames.jl`
covers everything I'm about to say comprehensively -
I've read it several times, and it is very clear.

But something just clicked for me in a way it never has before - not sure entirely how,
but I did something complicated in one go!
So I thought I'd share the way it makes sense to me
in case there are others with similar brains to mine :wink:.
Before I get to that, I should say a few things about `DataFrame`s,
`GroupedDataFrame`s, and the basic `select()`, `transform()`, and `combine()`
invocations.

## The easy stuff

One of the more powerful features of `DataFrames.jl` is the ability to
make a `GroupedDataFrame` using one or more columns as "keys".
Each subgroup is then just a view into the original `DataFrame`,
but acts like a `DataFrame` in its own right.

So to set this up, let's make a `df` that's similar
to what I've been working with recently -
a table of metadata about individual patient visits
Each `subject` may come in multiple times,
and get a few different things measured.
In my case, I'm most interested in visits where the subjects
collected a stool sample that I have microbiome data for.

```julia-repl
julia> df = DataFrame(
           subject = repeat(1:3; inner = 4),
           timepoint = repeat(1:4; outer = 3),
           thing1 = rand(12),
           thing2 = rand(60:100, 12),
           sample = [missing, missing, "s1", "s2", "s10", missing, "s13", "s20", missing, missing, missing, missing]
       )
12×5 DataFrame
 Row │ subject  timepoint  thing1    thing2  sample
     │ Int64    Int64      Float64   Int64   String?
─────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────
   1 │       1          1  0.514054      90  missing
   2 │       1          2  0.778417      60  missing
   3 │       1          3  0.157212      91  s1
   4 │       1          4  0.27137       69  s2
   5 │       2          1  0.867191      67  s10
   6 │       2          2  0.254406      78  missing
   7 │       2          3  0.925755      77  s13
   8 │       2          4  0.060332      87  s20
   9 │       3          1  0.9863        81  missing
  10 │       3          2  0.183848      98  missing
  11 │       3          3  0.190012      77  missing
  12 │       3          4  0.300867      71  missing
```

Often we want to get summaries on a per-subject basis,
or do other things within just the samples.
Using `groupby` and `combine`, this is quite easy.

```julia-repl
julia> gdf = groupby(df, :subject);

julia> combine(gdf,
           "thing1" => mean,
           "thing2" => median,
           "sample" => (col -> any(!ismissing, col)) => "has_sample"
       )
3×4 DataFrame
 Row │ subject  thing1_mean  thing2_median  has_sample
     │ Int64    Float64      Float64        Bool
─────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1 │       1     0.430263           79.5        true
   2 │       2     0.526921           77.5        true
   3 │       3     0.415257           79.0       false
```

The "mini-language" is the bits with `=>`.
Each operation works on columns,
so `"thing1" => mean` returns `mean(subdf.thing1)`
for each of the `SubDataFrame`s
(I could also have done `"thing1" => mean => "other name"`
to change the name of the resulting column).

My operation on `"sample"` doesn't have a built-in function to apply,
but using "anonymous" functions is pretty straightforward in this context -
just remember that you're function argument is the *column* (as a vector).
That is, writing `(col -> any(!ismissing, col))` as above is equivalent
to writing a named function that takes one column as an argument, eg:

```julia-repl
julia> function has_sample(col)
           # any elements of the column are not missing
           return any(!ismissing, col)
       end
has_sample (generic function with 1 method)

julia> combine(gdf, "sample" => has_sample => "has_sample")
3×2 DataFrame
 Row │ subject  has_sample
     │ Int64    Bool
─────┼─────────────────────
   1 │       1        true
   2 │       2        true
   3 │       3       false
```


Another thing I do frequently is some per-column transformations.
To be consistent, `transform` operations also work on whole-columns.
Most of the time, I want to do things with `transform()` on individual rows,
but happily there's a conventient `ByRow()` constructor that makes this easy,
and having access to the whole column can sometimes be useful.
For example, if I want to get the "relative abundance" (or total sum scaled result):

```julia-repl
julia> transform(gdf,
           "thing1" => ByRow(x-> x*100) => "thing1_perc",
           "thing2" => (col-> map(el-> el / sum(col), col)) => "thing2_tss" # total sum scale
       )
12×7 DataFrame
 Row │ subject  timepoint  thing1    thing2  sample   thing1_perc  thing2_tss
     │ Int64    Int64      Float64   Int64   String?  Float64      Float64

```

## Getting complicated

OK, so I think that stuff is pretty straightforward,
but what if we want to do something more complicated,
maybe involving more than one column and their interactions.
For example, one thing I wanted to do recently was to check a
*future* value for a given stool sample. For example, I want

1. If a timepoint doesn't have a stool sample, ignore
2. Otherwise, find the *next* timepoint that has `thing1`
   and use that value (even if *that* timepoint *doesn't* have a stool sample), BUT
3. my timepoints aren't guaranteed to be in order, AND
4. I'm not guaranteed to have a measurement in the future, or it may not be the next timepoint.

So let's show off some of those complications a bit:

```julia-repl
julia> df.thing1 = [rand() < 0.4 ? missing : x for x in df.thing1];

julia> df = df[randperm(12), :];

julia> gdf = groupby(df, :subject)
GroupedDataFrame with 3 groups based on key: subject
First Group (4 rows): subject = 1
 Row │ subject  timepoint  thing1          thing2  sample
     │ Int64    Int64      Float64?        Int64   String?
─────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1 │       1          4  missing             69  s2
   2 │       1          1  missing             90  missing
   3 │       1          3        0.157212      91  s1
   4 │       1          2  missing             60  missing
⋮
Last Group (4 rows): subject = 3
 Row │ subject  timepoint  thing1          thing2  sample
     │ Int64    Int64      Float64?        Int64   String?
─────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1 │       3          2  missing             98  missing
   2 │       3          1        0.9863        81  missing
   3 │       3          3        0.190012      77  missing
   4 │       3          4        0.300867      71  missing
```

To make this work, we need to know about the `AsTable()` modifier for `transform`,
which gives us a `NamedTuple` to work with for each group,
where each key contains a column.
That is `AsTable("timepoint", "thing1", "sample")` will effectively give us

```
julia> (; timepoint = gdf[1].timepoint, thing1 = gdf[1].thing1, sample = gdf[1].sample)
(timepoint = [4, 1, 3, 2], thing1 = Union{Missing, Float64}[missing, missing, 0.15721238855765696, missing], sample = Union{Missing, String}["s2", missing, "s1", missing])
```

Two more things to be aware of: first, for complicated anonymous functions, we can use `begin .. end` syntax
to make things more manageable, even within another function. That is:

```
args -> begin
    # function body
end
```

and second, our result needs to be a vector or another `Table`-compatible object
(like a Namedtuple with columns) that has the same length as the original.

We these things in mind, check this out... I didn't get it on the first try, but it was close..


```julia-repl
julia> transform!(gdf, AsTable(["timepoint", "thing1", "sample"]) => nt -> begin
           futures = map(eachindex(nt.timepoint)) do i # loop through row indexes
               timepoint = nt.timepoint
               srt = sortperm(timepoint) # so we can get the right order
               sample = nt.sample
               thing1 = nt.thing1

               ismissing(sample[i]) && return missing # (1) if there's no sample, ignore
               fidx = findfirst(j -> timepoint[srt][j] > timepoint[i] && # Checks the sorted timepoint index to make sure it's bigger
                                     !ismissing(thing1[srt][j]), # checks that `thing1` (sorted by timepoint) has a value
                                eachindex(timepoint) # using indexes in case samples are something like [1,3,4,6]
                )
               isnothing(fidx) && return missing
               return thing1[srt][fidx]
           end
           return futures
       end => "future_thing1");

julia> sort(df, ["subject", "timepoint"]) # just to check

```

We ca see that row 5 `(; subject = 2, timepoint = 1)`
correctly gets its future score from timepoint 3 (row 7)
since timepoint 2 didn't have a score,
Subjects 1 and 3 don't have any stool samples with a valid future `thing1`.

This feels complicated, but honestly, it's way easier than a number of other things I tried,
more robust, and faster too!
It takes a bit of thinking functionally, and one needs to remember the business with `NamedTuple`s,
but after that, it's actually straightforward... famous last words!
