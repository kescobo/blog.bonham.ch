This was my first time at the Lake Arrowhead Microbial Genomics meeting,
and it was excellent!
There were tons of great talks, friendly people and a beautiful location.
Plus the food was fantastic, and the beer and wine were free
(Jeffery Miller was insistant that this was important).

I feel like my head is bursting with information
and I can barely remember any of the talks, but happily I [took notes][1].

I also presented a poster on the project I recently started
with Vanja Klepac-Ceraj to investigate the effect of the human microbiome
on childhood cognitive development. There's not much there yet, but hopefully
by #LAMG2020 I'll have much more!
