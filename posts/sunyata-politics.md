Another pitfall that befalls us humans due to the fundamental emptiness of concepts
is that it can lead to profound and baffling failures to communicate
when the words we use actually **don't** refer to the same underlying models.
Or, more perniciously, when a model that is useful (though of course still wrong!)
in one context is applied in a different context where it's not.

Just to take two totally not controversial and unlikely to get me cancelled political debates:
let's consider race and gender - are they biological reality or social constructs?
Yes. Also no. 

I wish this were simply an academic discussion,
but given a recent executive order
and a bunch of recent right-wing talking points,
it's unfortunately timely.
Let's get into it.

### Race as a biological reality 

All humans are descended from a common ancestor that lived in Africa,
and due to various quirks of geography, migration, culture, and conquest,
we are not, as a population, "well mixed" genetically speaking. 
Throw in the occasional interbreeding with neanderthal and possibly other hominids,
and we have a historically geographic clustering of genotypes.

Some of these genotypes are linked to readily observable phenotypes,
such as melanin content in the skin and hair, epicanthic folds on the eyelids, etc.
There are also less readily observable phenotypes like metabolism of certain drugs,
and these sometimes appear to segregate with the things we can see.

When you map genotype onto self-identitified race,
there's a pretty clear link.
And this can have important implications in certain medical contexts -
for example, if a patient says they're Jewish,
a different diagnosis 
[[look at some other examples here]]
might be called for than if they don't.

### Race as a social construct

Of course, when we use the term "race" in discourse,
we're almost never talking about genotypes.
The best illustration of this fact in my mind is the fact
that sub-Saharan Africa has the largest genetic diversity
of anywhere on the planet -
peoples on basically every other continent are the result
of a handful of migrations and subsequent genetic bottlenecks,
which narrows the generic diversity they've been playing with.

In other words,
if you selected two humans that we'd classify racially as "black" at random,
they'd be less genetically similar on average than an average
African American and Northern European pairing.

And in any case, people have been using terms like "race"
for much longer than we've known about genes and their relationship to traits,
the meaning of the term has changed over time,
and continues to change (see eg How the Irish Became White).
We use race now as a short hand (a model!) for a loose group
of cultural, historical, geographical, and yes, ancestral relationships. 

### Biology or social? Yes and no to both 

So yes, race has some biological reality.
It's also a social construct.
This dual nature is not a problem,
until people start asserting the fundamental truth or falsehood of the other side.

Example here

## Sex and Gender

### Sex as biological reality

Nature has come up with all kinds of ways to coordinate sexual reproduction,
including fungi that have dozens of "sexes",
microbes that can have sex or go without,
plants that are two sexes at the same time,
and animals that change sex depending on environmental conditions, etc. 

But for us mammals, it tends to be a pretty straightforward -
two sexes, by convention the female produces the larger gamete,
and males produce the smaller.
Female mammals also gestate the young internally,
and lactate to provide nourishment to newborns.

Another important biological feature of sex is dimorphism -
that is, how phenotypically different are males and females,
outside of reproductive physiology?
Humans are sort of middle-of-the-road in terms of sexual dimorphism,
with males on average being physically slightly taller and more muscular,
but with plenty of overlap in the normal distributions.

### Gender as social construct 

Sexual dimorphism is also implicated in behavior,
but here it starts to get a bit tricky to determine how much of the
differences in *gender expression* -
that is, male- and female-stereotyped behavior -
can be attributed to biology.
Some behavioral dimorphism is surely biological
(eg higher testosterone typically leads to higher aggression),
and some is surely cultural
(eg honor cultures may increase male aggression
in response to perceived slights),
but isolating the precise proportion of nature vs nurture is,
as it always tends to be, a mugs game.

In any case, culture can have a massive influence
on the actual expression of even biologically-driven traits.
For example, the on-average size-and-height difference between
males and females could be reversed by a culture that
honored female children over male if it tended to feed them better. 

And of course, there are huge swaths of gender expression,
such as grooming behavior, fashion, and body modifications
that pretty clearly have next to no biological underpinning.

### Biology or culture?

Again, it's both.
Context matters, and the situations in which activists
on either side of an issue chose to invoke biology
(and which facts they chose to ignore)
tells you more about the conclusion they want to reach
than about their actual knowledge of cells and molecules.

## Implications for policy and politics 

The upshot of all of this ambiguity
is that anyone that's trying to argue that biology *obviously* supports their ideological position
is over-selling.
Even ignoring the naturalistic fallacy -
the mistaken belief that something which is natural is also normatively good -
actual biology is never as cut and dry as political actors would have you believe.
And in any case, it doesn't matter -
we have to make social, moral, and political decisions based on values.

For example, let's take the issue of trans women competing in sports.
There's an argument-from-biology that goes like this:

1. People that have gone through male puberty tend to be taller,
   have more bone density, and
