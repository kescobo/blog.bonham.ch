<p>Earlier this week, I got an e-mail from Lucia Santamaria from the "<a href="https://icsugendergapinscience.org/work-packages/publication-patterns/">Gender Gap in
Science</a>" project from the International Council for Science. They are
trying to systematically measure the gender gap in a number of ways, including
looking at publication records. One of the important parts of their effort is to
find ways to validate methods of gender assignment or inference.</p>
<p>Lucia was writing about some data found in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005134">the paper I wrote with with Melanie
Stefan</a> about women in computational biology. In particular, she
wanted the dataset that we got from Filardo et. al. that had a list of ~3000
journal articles with known first-author genders. This is a great dataset to
have, since the authors of that paper did all the hard work of actually going
one-by-one through papers and finding the author genders by hand (often
searching institutional websites and social media profiles for pictures etc).</p>
<p>This allowed us to validate our gender inference based on author first name
against a dataset where the truth is known (it did pretty well).</p>
<img src="/categorical-ambiguity/assets/img/gender_supp1c.png" alt="checking gender inference against known genders"><p>And that's what Lucia wants to do as well. There's just one problem: the
form of the data from Filardo and colleagues is human-readable, but not machine-
readable<sup><a href="#fn_dataset">[1]</a></sup>
<a id="fnref_dataset"></a>
. For example, one row of the data looks like this:</p>
<table class="">
<thead>
<th > <code>Article_ID</code> </th>
<th > <code>Full_Title</code> </th>
<th > <code>Link_to_Article</code> </th>
<th > <code>Journal</code> </th>
<th > <code>Year</code> </th>
<th > <code>Month</code> </th>
<th > <code>First Author Gender</code> </th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td > Aaby et al. (2010) </td>
<td > Non-specific effects of standard measles vaccine at 4.5 and 9 months of age on childhood mortality: randomised controlled trial </td>
<td > NA </td>
<td > BMJ </td>
<td > 2010 </td>
<td > 12 - Dec </td>
<td > Male </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>What we'd really like to have is some unique identifier (eg the Pubmed ID or
doi) associated with each record. That would make it much easier to cross-
reference with other datasets, including the table of hundreds of thousands of
publications that we downloaded as part of this study. I had this when we
published - it's how we validated our method, but I'm embarrassed to say it
didn't get included with the paper, and I recently had to delete my old computer
backups which is the only place it lived.</p>
<p>I told her how we initially did this, and it sounds like she managed to make it
work herself, but I thought it would be worth documenting how I did it
originally (and maybe improve it slightly). So we've got a table with titles,
author last names, years, and journals, and what we want is a pubmed id or doi.</p>
<p>I'm using <a href="http://julialang.org">julia</a> as my go-to language these days, and the first step
is to load in the table as a dataframe that we can manipulate:</p>
<pre><code class="julia">using DataFrames
using CSV

df = CSV.read(&quot;data/known-gender.csv&quot;)

# get an array with the &quot;article id&quot; as a string
ids = Vector&lbrace;String&rbrace;(df[:Article_ID])
@show ids[1]</code></pre>

<hr>
<pre><code class="julia">ids[1] = &quot;Aaby et al. (2010)&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We can see that the current form of the <code>:Article_ID</code> has both author name and
the year, but we want to be able to handle these separately. But they all take
the same form, the author name, sometimes followed by "et al.", followed by the
year in parentheses<sup><a href="#fn_caveat">[2]</a></sup>
<a id="fnref_caveat"></a>
. So I'm going to use regular expressions, which
can look like gobbledegook if you're not familiar with it. It's beyond the scope
of this post to describe it, but I highly recomend <a href="https://regexr.com/">regexr</a> as a resource for
learning and testing. The regex I used for this is composed of 3 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The author name, which can have some number of letters, spaces, <code>-</code>, and <code>'</code>: <code>([\w\s\-']+)</code><ul>
<li>these are also at the beginning of the line, so I add a <code>^</code> (just to be safe)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then "et al.": <code>et al\.</code><ul>
<li>the <code>.</code> is a special character, so it's escaped with <code>\</code></li>
<li>this is also optional, so I wrap it in parentheses and add <code>?</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The year, which is 4 digits, and wrapped in parentheses: <code>\((\d&lbrace;4&rbrace;)\)</code><ul>
<li>the inner parentheses are so I can grab it as a group</li>
<li>it should be the end, so I finish with <code>$</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the <a href="https://regexr.com/3hpod">complete regex</a> : <code>^([\w\s\-']+)( et al\.)? \((\d&lbrace;4&rbrace;)\)$</code></p>
<p>And now I want to apply that search to everything in the <code>Article_ID</code> column:</p>
<pre><code class="julia"># confirm this matches every row
length(ids) # --&gt; 3204
sum(.!ismatch.(r&quot;^([\w\s\-']+)( et al\.)? \((\d&lbrace;4&rbrace;)\)$&quot;, ids)) # --&gt; 3204

# apply match across the whole ids array with `match.()`
matches = match.(r&quot;^([\w\s\-']+)( et al\.)? \((\d&lbrace;4&rbrace;)\)$&quot;, ids)
# get the last name of first authors
firstauthors = [m.captures[1] for m in matches]
# get the year... yeah there's a column for this, but since we have it...
years = [parse(Int, m.captures[3]) for m in matches]</code></pre>

<hr>
<pre><code class="julia">3204-element Array&lbrace;Int64,1&rbrace;:
 2010
 2007
     ⋮
 2007
 2011</code></pre>
<p>We also have a column for the journal names, but pubmed searching is a bit
idiosyncratic and works better if you use the right abreviations. So next, I
built a dictionary of abbreviations, and used an array comprehension to get a
new array with the journal names:</p>
<pre><code class="julia">journals = Vector&lbrace;String&rbrace;(df[:Journal])

replacements = Dict(
    &quot;Archives of Internal Medicine&quot; =&gt; &quot;Arch Intern Med&quot;,
    &quot;Annals of Internal Medicine&quot; =&gt; &quot;Ann Intern Med&quot;,
    &quot;The Lancet&quot; =&gt; &quot;Lancet&quot;,
    &quot;NEJM&quot; =&gt; &quot;N Engl J Med&quot;
    )

journals = [in(x, keys(replacements)) ? replacements[x] : x for x in journals]</code></pre>

<hr>
<pre><code class="julia">3204-element Array&lbrace;String,1&rbrace;:
 &quot;BMJ&quot;
 &quot;Ann Intern Med&quot;
 ⋮
 &quot;Lancet&quot;
 &quot;Ann Intern Med&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Finally, words like "and", "in", "over" don't help a lot when searching, and the
titles currently have special characters (like <code>:</code> or <code>()</code>) that also don't help
or could even hurt our ability to search. So I took the title column, and built
new strings using only words that are 5 characters or more. I did this all in
one go, but to explain, the <code>matchall()</code> function finds all of the 5 or more
letter words (that's <code>\w&lbrace;5,&rbrace;</code> in regex) and returns an array of matches. Then
the <code>join()</code> function puts them together in a single string (separated by a
space since I passed <code>' '</code> as an argument):</p>
<pre><code class="julia">titles = join.(matchall.(r&quot;\w&lbrace;5,&rbrace;&quot;, Vector&lbrace;String&rbrace;(df[:Full_Title])), ' ')</code></pre>

<hr>
<pre><code class="julia">3204-element Array&lbrace;String,1&rbrace;:
 &quot;specific effects standard measles vaccine months childhood mortality randomised controlled trial&quot;
 &quot;Tiotropium Combination Placebo Salmeterol Fluticasone Salmeterol Treatment Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Randomized Trial&quot;
 ⋮
 &quot;Artemether lumefantrine versus amodiaquine sulfadoxine pyrimethamine uncomplicated falciparum malaria Burkina randomised inferiority trial&quot;
 &quot;Patient Interest Sharing Personal Health Record Information Based Survey&quot;</code></pre>
<p>So now we've got all the elements of our search, and I just put them into an
array of tuples to make them easier to deal with:</p>
<pre><code class="julia">searches = collect(zip(titles, firstauthors, journals, years))</code></pre>

<hr>
<pre><code class="julia">3204-element Array&lbrace;Tuple&lbrace;String,SubString&lbrace;String&rbrace;,String,Int64,Int64&rbrace;,1&rbrace;:
 (&quot;specific effects standard measles vaccine months childhood mortality randomised controlled trial&quot;, &quot;Aaby&quot;, &quot;BMJ&quot;, 12, 2010)
 (&quot;Tiotropium Combination Placebo Salmeterol Fluticasone Salmeterol Treatment Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Randomized Trial&quot;, &quot;Aaron&quot;, &quot;Ann Intern Med&quot;, 4, 2007)
 ⋮</code></pre>
<p>Finally, I iterated through this array and composed searches, using the
<a href="https://github.com/BioJulia/BioServices.jl"><code>BioServices.EUtils</code></a> package to do the search and retrieval.</p>
<pre><code class="julia">using BioServices.EUtils

for s in searches
    # If you do too many queries in a row, esearch raises an exception.
    # The solution is to pause (here for 10 sections) and then try again.
    try
        res = esearch(db=&quot;pubmed&quot;, term=&quot;($(s[1]) [title]) AND ($(s[2]) [author]) AND ($(s[3]) [ journal]) AND ($(s[4]) [pdat])&quot;)
    catch
        sleep(10)
        res = esearch(db=&quot;pubmed&quot;, term=&quot;($(s[1]) [title]) AND ($(s[2]) [author]) AND ($(s[3]) [ journal]) AND ($(s[4]) [pdat])&quot;)
    end


    doc = parsexml(res.data)
    #= this returns an array of pmids, since in the xml, they're separated by
    newlines. The `strip` function removes leading and trailing newlines, but
    not ones in between ids. =#
    i = split(content(findfirst(doc, &quot;//IdList&quot;)) |&gt; strip, '\n')

    if length(i) == 1
        #= if no ids are returned, there's an array with just an empty string,
        in which case I add 0 to the array =#
        length(i[1]) == 0 ? push!(pmids, 0) : push!(pmids, parse(Int, i[1]))
    else
        # if there are more than 1 pmids returned, I just add 9 to the array
        push!(pmids, 9)
    end
end</code></pre>
<p>I actually did better than the last time I tried this - 2447 records associated
with only 1 pmid. 13 of the searches had more than 1 pmid, and the rest (744)
didn't return any hits.</p>
<pre><code class="julia">@show sum(pmids .&gt; 9)
@show sum(pmids .== 9)
@show sum(pmids .== 0)</code></pre>

<hr>
<pre><code class="julia">sum(pmids .&gt; 9) = 2447
sum(pmids .== 9) = 13
sum(pmids .== 0) = 744</code></pre>
<p>I added the ids to the dataframe and saved it as a new file (so I don't have to
do the searching again). Since I have the urls for many of the papers, I was
thinking I could try to identify the doi's associated with them from their
webpages, but that will have to wait until another time.</p>
<p>For now, the last step is to save it as a csv and send it off to Lucia:</p>
<pre><code class="julia">CSV.write(&quot;data/withpmids.csv&quot;, df)</code></pre>
