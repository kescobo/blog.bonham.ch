Well, it's been far too long since I wrote anything here. In the mean time I've:

- completed the [HMX biochemistry](https://onlinelearning.hms.harvard.edu/hmx/courses/hmx-biochemistry/) course
- Got two papers accepted ([eLife paper](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22144) on HGT is out, PLoS Comp Bio paper needs some final touches)
- started a postdoc in the [Huttenhower lab](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/)
- and... that seems like enough

Also finally updated the header image on this site to be one of mine rather than
the default.

In any case - I'm planning to start blogging more again, though my writing
muscles are a bit atrophied from disuse. Now that I'm doing a proper postdoc,
I might actually be able to set aside some time each week to write something.

Or maybe I'm just paving the road to hell...
