There are lots of ways to be in touch!

## Code

Most of my code is [on github][github], including the code for [this site][site-code]!
Some other code is on [gitlab][gitlab], though I mostly put private repos there.

I spend a lot of time on [julia social channels][julia-social],
including slack (`@kescobo`), zulip (`@kevin Bonham`), and [discourse][julia-discourse].

## Social

I haven't been doing much tweeting since the Muskpocolypse,
but when I did, it was [@kevbonham][twitter].
More recently, I've been on Mastodon at [@kbonham@scicomm.xyz][mastodon],
bluesky at [@kevbonham.bsky.social][bluesky],
and on Lemmy at [https://mander.xyz/u/kevin][lemmy].

I've got a [LinkedIn][linkedin],
though don't count on timely replies there.
